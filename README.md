# Qiskit 1.0.2

- This notebook demonstrates computational basis measurements of qubits in qiskit. that have been measured on a non-computational basis. <br>
- The results have been verified using multiple shots.
- The unitary transform applied to change basis, has been demonstrated in the quantum circuit.

  ### TRANSPILATION
  
  Transpilation in Qiskit refers to the process of rewriting a given input quantum circuit to match the topology of a specific quantum device <br>
  and optimize the circuit instructions for execution on noisy quantum systems. This process is done to ensure that the quantum circuit can be <br>
  executed accurately and efficiently on the quantum computing hardware of the target device.

  This notebook also demonstrates the universal single-qubit gates, in terms of which the unitary transform can be expressed. (Transpilation)
